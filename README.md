Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning & Streamlit
This project leverages machine learning to predict heart disease based on patient health parameters. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and an interactive Streamlit web app for user-friendly predictions.

Features

✅ Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)

✅ Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM)

✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

✅ Interactive Web App using Streamlit

🏋️‍♂️ Train the Model

      python heart_disease_prediction.py
   
🎛️ Run the Streamlit App

     streamlit run app.py





**Model Performance**


      Logistic Regression: 85% accuracy
      SVM :  0.86% accuracy
      Decision Tree:   0.81% accuracy



   
**Future Improvements**

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- Deploying the Streamlit app online  
- Exploring deep learning models for improved prediction
